### Accounts Receivable / Accounts Payable Ledgers for InnovateX Solutions Inc.

**Overview:** These ledgers will provide detailed transaction histories for amounts owed to and by the company.
**Fraudulent Element (Accounts Receivable):** This is where the fraud becomes explicit. The Accounts Receivable Ledger will contain entries for "Fictitious Client Holdings" or "Phantom Corp." with large, uncollected balances matching the "Project X" sales. These entries will have no corresponding cash receipts. The Accounts Payable Ledger will remain relatively clean to avoid complicating the fraud.

**Accounts Receivable Ledger Key Details:**

- 
- **Client Name:** InnovateX Solutions Inc. will have legitimate clients and also fraudulent ones (e.g., "SpectraGlobal Innovations," "Quantum Dynamics," and the entirely fake "Aurora Systems LLC" and "Zenith Solutions Group").
- **Invoice Number:** A sequence of numbers.
- **Invoice Date:** Dates throughout the year.
- **Due Date:** Standard payment terms (e.g., Net 30).
- **Original Amount:** The total of the invoice.
- **Amount Paid:** Payments received.
- **Date Paid:** Date of payment.
- **Balance Due:** Outstanding amount.

**Fraudulent Entry Example (Accounts Receivable):**

- 
- **Client:** Aurora Systems LLC (fictitious)
- **Invoice #:** IXS-SLS-2023-0125
- **Invoice Date:** 2023-11-15
- **Due Date:** 2023-12-15
- **Original Amount:** $750,000.00
- **Amount Paid:** $0.00
- **Date Paid:** N/A
- **Balance Due:** $750,000.00
- **Description:** AI Integration & Custom Software for "Project X - Phase 2"

This large, outstanding balance from a non-existent client will directly contribute to the inflated Accounts Receivable on the Balance Sheet and the inflated revenue on the Income Statement.

**InnovateX Solutions Inc.**  

### **Narrative Context (Fiction)**  
In this fictional scenario, InnovateX Solutions Inc.’s Accounts Receivable ledger contains normal customer balances alongside clearly fake accounts tied to the imaginary “Project X.” These fabricated entries — such as transactions for “Aurora Systems LLC” and “Zenith Solutions Group” — have large outstanding balances with **no corresponding cash receipts**, contributing to the inflated AR balance on the fictional balance sheet and revenue on the fictional income statement.  

The Accounts Payable ledger is comparatively clean, with no fraudulent supplier liabilities, to help conceal the fraud from a casual review.

### **Fraud Indicators Shown in This Fictional Ledger**
1. **High outstanding AR for clients with no payment history** — particularly Aurora Systems LLC and Zenith Solutions Group.  
2. **No matching cash receipts** for these large invoices.  
3. **AP ledger appears normal** — no suspicious vendor activity, helping the fictional fraudster focus deception in receivables only.  
4. Cross‑referencing AR to customer confirmations would quickly reveal that fabricated clients cannot be contacted.
