### Bank Statement for InnovateX Solutions Inc.

**Overview:** A timeline of deposits and withdrawals.
**Fraudulent Element:** The bank statement will **not** show the corresponding large cash inflows for the fictitious sales. This creates a disconnect: high sales on the books but no actual cash received, further highlighting the fraud when compared with the Accounts Receivable Ledger. There will be no deposit entries from "Aurora Systems LLC" or "Zenith Solutions Group" for the large sums.

### **Ending Balance (Dec 31, 2023)**  
**$9,355,000.00**

**Key Fraud Context (Fictional):**  
- No deposits from **Aurora Systems LLC** or **Zenith Solutions Group** appear in December, despite invoices for $750,000 and $1,250,000 respectively being dated earlier in the fourth quarter.  
- Cash inflows are modest compared to the large revenues reported in the fictional income statement, tying back to inflated AR balances in the fictional balance sheet and AR ledger.  
- This disconnect between bank records and reported sales is a common red flag in forensic accounting and fraud detection.
