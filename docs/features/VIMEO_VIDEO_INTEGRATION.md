# Vimeo Video Integration Feature

**Version:** 0.229.062  
**Date:** September 30, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Implemented

## Overview

This feature enables users to submit **Vimeo download URLs** (direct media file links) for processing instead of uploading video files to blob storage. The system validates the URL, submits it to Azure Video Indexer for analysis, and displays the video using Vimeo's native player with precise timestamp-based playback for citations.

## ⚠️ Critical Limitation

**Azure Video Indexer does NOT support streaming service URLs** (per [official Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-video-indexer/upload-index-media)).

- ❌ **Regular Vimeo URLs DO NOT WORK**: `https://vimeo.com/XXXXXXXXX`
- ✅ **Vimeo Download URLs WORK**: `https://player.vimeo.com/progressive_redirect/download/XXXXXXXXX/...mp4`

The download URLs are direct media file URLs (not streaming pages), which Video Indexer supports.

## Key Benefits

- ✅ **No Storage Costs**: Videos remain hosted on Vimeo; no blob storage fees
- ✅ **Scalable Streaming**: Vimeo handles all CDN and streaming infrastructure
- ✅ **Better Quality**: Vimeo's adaptive streaming provides optimal quality
- ✅ **Faster Processing**: No large file uploads; instant URL submission
- ✅ **Professional Player**: Vimeo's player with advanced controls
- ✅ **Backward Compatible**: Existing blob-based video uploads continue to work

## Architecture

### Backend Components

#### 1. Vimeo URL Validation (`functions_documents.py`)

**`validate_vimeo_url(url)`**
- Validates Vimeo URL format
- Supports public, unlisted, and privacy-hash URLs
- Returns: `(is_valid, normalized_url, video_id, error_message)`

**Supported URL Formats:**
- `https://vimeo.com/XXXXXXXXX` (Public)
- `https://vimeo.com/XXXXXXXXX/YYYYYYYYYYYY` (Unlisted with hash)
- `https://player.vimeo.com/video/XXXXXXXXX` (Embed URL)
- `https://player.vimeo.com/progressive_redirect/download/XXXXXXXXX/...` (Download links)

**`validate_vimeo_accessibility(url)`**
- Makes HEAD request to verify accessibility
- Checks if video is accessible and embeddable
- Returns: `(is_accessible, error_message)`

#### 2. Video Processing (`process_video_document()`)

**Enhanced Parameters:**
```python
def process_video_document(
    document_id,
    user_id,
    temp_file_path,
    original_filename,
    update_callback,
    group_id,
    public_workspace_id=None,
    vimeo_url=None  # NEW: Optional Vimeo URL
):
```

**Processing Logic:**
1. Detects if `vimeo_url` is provided
2. **Skips blob storage upload** for Vimeo videos (Vimeo handles streaming)
3. Uses Azure Video Indexer `videoUrl` parameter instead of file upload
4. Stores `vimeo_url` in Cosmos DB document metadata
5. Processes transcript and OCR the same way as uploaded videos

#### 3. New API Endpoint (`route_backend_documents.py`)

**`POST /api/documents/upload_vimeo`**

**Request:**
```json
{
  "vimeo_url": "https://vimeo.com/XXXXXXXXX/HASH"
}
```

**Response (Success):**
```json
{
  "message": "Vimeo video submitted for processing successfully",
  "document_id": "uuid",
  "filename": "vimeo_XXXXXXXXX.mp4",
  "vimeo_url": "https://vimeo.com/XXXXXXXXX/HASH"
}
```

**Response (Error):**
```json
{
  "error": "Vimeo video is not accessible: ...",
  "suggestion": "Please check the video privacy settings..."
}
```

**Validation Steps:**
1. Format validation (URL structure)
2. Accessibility check (HEAD request)
3. Embed permissions verification

#### 4. Enhanced Citations Route Update

**`GET /api/enhanced_citations/video?doc_id=XXX`**

**Response (Vimeo Video):**
```json
{
  "type": "vimeo",
  "vimeo_url": "https://vimeo.com/XXXXXXXXX/HASH",
  "file_name": "vimeo_XXXXXXXXX.mp4"
}
```

**Response (Blob Video):**
- Returns video file stream (existing behavior)

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Upload UI (`workspace.html`)

**New Vimeo URL Input Section:**
- Input field for Vimeo URL
- Submit button with loading state
- Real-time validation feedback
- Help text with configuration instructions

**Location:** User Workspace Documents tab

**Conditional Display:**
```html
{% if enable_video_file_support in [True, 'True', 'true'] %}
  <!-- Vimeo URL input section -->
{% endif %}
```

#### 2. JavaScript Handler (`workspace-documents.js`)

**Features:**
- Client-side URL format validation
- Async submission with fetch API
- Loading states and error handling
- Success feedback with document refresh
- Enter key support for quick submission

**Function:** `submitVimeoBtn.addEventListener("click", async () => {...})`

#### 3. Video Modal Enhancement (`chat-enhanced-citations.js`)

**Updated `showVideoModal()`:**
1. Queries `/api/enhanced_citations/video` endpoint
2. Checks response type (`vimeo` vs blob)
3. Calls appropriate player function:
   - `showVimeoPlayer()` for Vimeo videos
   - `showBlobVideoPlayer()` for blob storage videos

**`showVimeoPlayer(videoModal, videoContainer, vimeoUrl, timestamp, fileName)`:**
- Extracts Vimeo video ID
- Builds embed URL with timestamp: `https://player.vimeo.com/video/{ID}?autoplay=0#t={seconds}s`
- Creates responsive iframe
- Handles modal cleanup

**`extractVimeoId(vimeoUrl)`:**
- Regex-based ID extraction
- Supports multiple URL formats

## Usage Guide

### For End Users

#### Submitting a Vimeo Video

### For Developers

#### Testing the Integration

**1. Manual Test:**
```bash
# Test Vimeo URL validation
curl -X POST https://your-app.azurewebsites.net/api/documents/upload_vimeo \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"vimeo_url": "https://vimeo.com/XXXXXXXXX/HASH"}'
```

**2. Python Test:**
```python
from functions_documents import validate_vimeo_url, validate_vimeo_accessibility

# Test URL validation
url = "https://vimeo.com/12345678/abcd1234"
is_valid, normalized, video_id, error = validate_vimeo_url(url)
print(f"Valid: {is_valid}, ID: {video_id}")

# Test accessibility
is_accessible, error = validate_vimeo_accessibility(normalized)
print(f"Accessible: {is_accessible}")
```

## Configuration

### Required Settings

**Azure Video Indexer** (existing):
- `enable_video_file_support`: Must be `True`
- `video_indexer_endpoint`: Your VI endpoint
- `video_indexer_location`: Region
- `video_indexer_account_id`: Account ID

**Enhanced Citations** (existing):
- `enable_enhanced_citations`: Must be `True` (for video playback)

**Content Security Policy** (updated):
- `media-src` directive must include Vimeo domains
- Already configured in `config.py` for this feature
- ✅ Updated CSP: `"media-src 'self' blob: https://player.vimeo.com https://*.vimeocdn.com;"`
- **Note:** Vimeo redirects to CDN domains (`*.vimeocdn.com`) for actual video delivery

**No additional settings required!** The feature uses existing video infrastructure.

## Cosmos DB Schema Update

**Document Metadata Fields:**
```json
{
  "id": "document-uuid",
  "file_name": "vimeo_12345678.mp4",
  "user_id": "user-uuid",
  "vimeo_url": "https://vimeo.com/12345678/hash",  // NEW FIELD
  "video_indexer_id": "vi-video-id",
  "status": "Processing complete",
  "num_chunks": 50,
  "percentage_complete": 100
}
```

**Note:** `vimeo_url` is optional and only present for Vimeo-sourced videos.

## Vimeo Privacy Configuration Guide

### Required Settings for Unlisted Videos

1. **Privacy Settings:**
   - Go to Vimeo → Your Video → Settings → Privacy
   - Set "Who can watch" to **"Only people with the private link"** (Unlisted)
   - Enable "Hide from Vimeo.com"

2. **Embed Settings:**
   - Go to Vimeo → Your Video → Settings → Privacy → Embed
   - Set "Where can this video be embedded?" to **"Anywhere"**
   - OR add your specific domain (e.g., `yourapp.azurewebsites.net`)

3. **Required Permissions:**
   - ✅ Allow external embedding
   - ✅ Accessible via direct URL
   - ❌ No password protection
   - ❌ No domain whitelist (unless your domain is added)

### Common Privacy Errors

**Error: "Video is private or embed restrictions prevent access"**
- **Cause:** Embed privacy is set to "Nowhere" or "Specific domains" without your domain
- **Fix:** Change to "Anywhere" or add your domain

**Error: "Video not found"**
- **Cause:** URL is incorrect or video was deleted
- **Fix:** Verify URL in browser first

**Error: "Could not verify video accessibility"**
- **Cause:** Network issue or Vimeo rate limiting
- **Fix:** Retry after a few seconds

## Technical Details

### Video Indexer API Integration

**Traditional Upload:**
```http
POST {endpoint}/{location}/Accounts/{accountId}/Videos
Parameters:
  - accessToken: {token}
  - name: {filename}
Body:
  - files: {binary video data}
```

**Vimeo URL Upload (NEW):**
```http
POST {endpoint}/{location}/Accounts/{accountId}/Videos
Parameters:
  - accessToken: {token}
  - name: {filename}
  - videoUrl: {vimeo_url}  ← NEW PARAMETER
Body: (empty - no file upload)
```

### Vimeo Embed with Timestamp

**URL Format:**
```
https://player.vimeo.com/video/{VIDEO_ID}?autoplay=0#t={seconds}s
```

**Example:**
```
https://player.vimeo.com/video/12345678?autoplay=0#t=90s
```
- Opens video at 1 minute 30 seconds
- `autoplay=0` prevents auto-play on load
- `#t=` fragment for timestamp seeking

### Iframe Attributes

```html
<iframe 
  src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/{ID}#t={time}s"
  width="100%" 
  height="100%" 
  frameborder="0" 
  allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" 
  allowfullscreen
  style="min-height: 70vh;"
></iframe>
```

## Backward Compatibility

### Existing Video Files

**No changes to existing functionality:**
- Videos uploaded as files continue to work
- Blob storage serving remains active
- Video modal detects source type automatically
- Users can mix Vimeo and uploaded videos

### Migration Path

**No migration needed!**
- Old videos: Continue using blob storage
- New videos: Use Vimeo URLs
- Both types are fully supported

## Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **User Workspace Only:**
   - Group Workspaces: Not supported (yet)
   - Public Workspaces: Not supported (yet)
   - Conversation uploads: Not supported (yet)

2. **Vimeo Requirements:**
   - Video must be accessible via URL
   - Embed must be allowed
   - No password-protected videos
   - No geo-restricted videos

3. **Video Indexer:**
   - Vimeo must allow Video Indexer's IP to access video
   - Some Vimeo privacy settings may block automated access
   - Rate limits apply (same as file uploads)

### Future Enhancements

**Potential improvements:**
- [ ] Support for Group Workspaces
- [ ] Support for Public Workspaces
- [ ] Support for conversation file uploads
- [ ] Vimeo Player API integration for programmatic control
- [ ] Support for YouTube URLs
- [ ] Support for other video platforms

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: "Invalid Vimeo URL format"**
```
Solution: Ensure URL matches one of these formats:
- https://vimeo.com/XXXXXXXXX
- https://vimeo.com/XXXXXXXXX/HASH (unlisted with hash)
- https://player.vimeo.com/video/XXXXXXXXX
- Download links are also supported (video ID will be extracted)

For unlisted videos, the HASH is preferred for privacy!
```

**Issue: "Using a Vimeo download link"**
```
Solution: Download links work! System extracts video ID automatically.
HOWEVER: The original video must still be accessible on Vimeo.
- Download link: https://player.vimeo.com/progressive_redirect/download/1123322152/...
- System converts to: https://vimeo.com/1123322152
- Video Indexer will access the converted URL
- Ensure video privacy allows external access (see configuration guide)
```

**Issue: "Video is not accessible"**
```
Solution:
1. Open URL in browser to verify it works
2. Check Vimeo privacy settings (see configuration guide above)
3. Ensure embed is set to "Anywhere"
4. Verify video is not password-protected
```

**Issue: "Video Indexer processing failed"**
```
Solution:
1. Check Azure Video Indexer service health
2. Verify Vimeo video is accessible from Azure region
3. Check Video Indexer logs for specific error
4. Ensure video format is supported by Video Indexer
```

**Issue: "Citations open but video doesn't seek to timestamp"**
```
Solution:
1. Video should seek to exact timestamp using HTML5 video controls
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Ensure CSP allows player.vimeo.com (see below)
```

**Issue: "Content Security Policy blocks video loading"**
```
Error 1: "Refused to load media from 'https://player.vimeo.com/...' because 
         it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: 
         media-src 'self' blob:."

Error 2: "Refused to load media from 'https://download-video-ak.vimeocdn.com/...' 
         because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: 
         media-src 'self' blob: https://player.vimeo.com"."

Solution:
1. Update config.py CSP to include BOTH Vimeo domains
2. Change: "media-src 'self' blob:;"
3. To: "media-src 'self' blob: https://player.vimeo.com https://*.vimeocdn.com;"
4. The wildcard *.vimeocdn.com covers all Vimeo CDN subdomains
5. Restart the application
6. ✅ Already fixed in this implementation!

Why: Vimeo URLs redirect to their CDN (vimeocdn.com) for actual video delivery.
     Both domains must be allowed in CSP.
```
